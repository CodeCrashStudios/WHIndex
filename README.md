# Waffle House Index

This is just a stupid project to try and get information about every Waffle House and eventally create a "Waffle House Index"

The Waffle House Index is a way to measure disaster severity by the amount of Waffle Houses closed. Since they are open 24 hours and rarely close even for natural disasters this can be used to measure that.
